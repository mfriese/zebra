## Short notice

Main purpose of this App is to reproduce the Mission Control Behavior of MacOS on Windows without installing a huge 3rd party app to do so. I got annoyed by not being able to do that so I came up with this little helper.

As of now moving the mouse into the upper left corener will show all open windows. There is a tray icon that can be used to end the application.

## TODO

The App works, so far so good. But there is still stuff to do ...

  * Proper Context Menu
  * Load icon from resources
  * clean up code
